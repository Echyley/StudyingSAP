#XTOL
type.ERPVariantProduct.changeable.description=This setting defines whether or not web shop customers are able to change the configuration of a product variant with the product ID still being retained. - If Changeable is True, customers can change or complete the configuration of the product variant while the product ID is retained. The price remains that of the product variant. - If Changeable is False, customers can still customize the product variant. However, in this case the system uses the variant\u2019s specification as a basis for the configuration of the associated base product (KMAT). The product ID changes over to the base product (KMAT). Customers are now configuring the configurable product, not changing the product variant. Note that pricing changes at that point \u2013 the variant will usually have a lower price than the configurable product. - Please ensure that this setting corresponds to your settings for that product variant in the SD requirements class in the SAP back end. For more information, see section 'Product Variants' in the documentation for SAP Product Configuration at help.hybris.com.
